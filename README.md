# Pizza Price Calculator (per area)
Use this simple Android or iOS App to compare different pizza sizes (square or round) to find the deal that offers the best price per cm².

While the square shaped "Party Pizza" often seems like the best deal to satisfy your party guests, ordering multiple round pizzas often scores the better deal in terms of pizza per cm². 

Use the simple interface to enter the sales information of up to three pizzas, two round ones and one square one, as this is the typical offer of available pizza sizes.
